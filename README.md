## 📖 About The Project

**Edu4Autism** is an interactive educational platform designed specifically for children on the autism spectrum. By leveraging **Mixed Reality (MR)** and **Gamification**, the application creates an engaging environment where learning happens through camera-based interactions.

Traditional learning methods can sometimes be challenging for autistic children. This project aims to bridge that gap by using augmented reality elements to make abstract concepts more tangible and fun. The "through camera" mechanic encourages active physical participation and visual engagement.

### 🌟 Key Goals
* **Engagement:** Increase attention span through interactive AR gameplay.
* **Learning:** Teach cognitive or social skills (e.g., emotion recognition, object identification) in a playful manner.
* **Accessibility:** Provide an easy-to-use interface suitable for children.
