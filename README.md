# Edu4Autism 🧩🎮

A mixed reality gamified platform for autistic kids to learn and play through camera interactions.

## 📖 About The Project

Edu4Autism is an interactive educational platform designed specifically for children on the autism spectrum. By leveraging **Mixed Reality (MR)** and **Gamification**, the application creates an engaging environment where learning happens through camera-based interactions.

Traditional learning methods can sometimes be challenging for autistic children. This project aims to bridge that gap by using augmented reality elements to make abstract concepts more tangible and fun. The "through camera" mechanic encourages active physical participation and visual engagement.

## 🌟 Key Goals

* **Engagement:** Increase attention span through interactive AR gameplay.
* **Learning:** Teach cognitive or social skills (e.g., emotion recognition, object identification) in a playful manner.
* **Accessibility:** Provide an easy-to-use interface suitable for children.

## ✨ Features

* **Mixed Reality Interaction:** Uses the device's camera to blend virtual learning elements with the real world.
* **Gamified Learning Modules:** Educational content wrapped in game mechanics to reward progress.
* **Interactive Camera Controls:** Users interact with the game world using visual markers or gestures captured by the camera.
* **Kid-Friendly UI:** Simple, colorful, and intuitive user interface designed for accessibility.

*(Note: As the project develops, specific game modes—such as vocabulary matching or emotion detection—can be listed here.)*

## 🛠️ Built With

* **Unity** - The primary game engine used for development.
* **C#** - The main programming language for game logic.
* **ShaderLab** - Used for custom visual effects.
* **AR Technology** - (Likely ARFoundation or Vuforia) for camera and mixed reality capabilities.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

* Unity Hub and Unity Editor (Check `ProjectSettings/ProjectVersion.txt` for the exact version).
* A webcam (for testing in the editor) or a mobile device (Android/iOS) for deployment.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SANJEEV8811/Edu4Autism.git
```

2. **Open in Unity**
   * Open Unity Hub.
   * Click `Add` and select the cloned `Edu4Autism` folder.
   * Click on the project name to open it in the Unity Editor.

3. **Run the Scene**
   * Navigate to the `Assets/Scenes` folder in the Project window.
   * Double-click the main scene (often named `SampleScene` or `MainMenu`) to load it.
   * Press the Play button at the top of the editor.

## 📱 How to Use

1. Ensure your device or computer has a working camera.
2. Launch the application.
3. Allow camera permissions when prompted.
4. Point the camera at the specific markers or interact with the screen as directed by the on-screen tutorial.
